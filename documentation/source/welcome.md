# SuperGradients

## Introduction
Welcome to SuperGradients, a free, open-source training library for PyTorch-based deep learning models.
SuperGradients allows you to train or fine-tune SOTA pre-trained models for all the most commonly applied computer vision tasks with just one training library. We currently support object detection, image classification and semantic segmentation for videos and images.


## Why use SuperGradients?
 
### Built-in SOTA Models

Easily load and fine-tune production-ready, [pre-trained SOTA models](model_zoo.md) that incorporate best practices and validated hyper-parameters for achieving best-in-class accuracy (Yolox, PP-YoloE, STDC, DDRNet, and PP-LiteSeg).

### Easily Reproduce our Results
       
Why do all the grind work, if we already did it for you? leverage tested and proven [recipes](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/tree/master/src/super_gradients/recipes) & [code examples](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/tree/master/src/super_gradients/examples) for a wide range of computer vision models generated by our team of deep learning experts. Easily configure your own or use plug & play hyperparameters for training, dataset, and architecture.
    
### Production Readiness and Ease of Integration
    
All SuperGradients modelsâ€™ are production ready in the sense that they are compatible with deployment tools such as TensorRT (Nvidia) and OpenVINO (Intel) and can be easily taken into production. With a few lines of code you can easily integrate the models into your codebase.
   
## Getting Started
Check out our [Quickstart tutorial](QuickstartBasicToolkit.md) to get learn the basic of SuperGradients.

You can also start from our tutorial on [Detection](ObjectDetection.md), [Segmentation](Segmentation.md) or [Pose Estimation](PoseEstimation.md).

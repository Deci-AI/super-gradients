# SuperGradients

## Introduction
Welcome to SuperGradients, a free, open-source training library for PyTorch-based deep learning models.
SuperGradients allows you to train or fine-tune SOTA pre-trained models for all the most commonly applied computer vision tasks with just one training library. We currently support object detection, image classification and semantic segmentation for videos and images.


## Why use SuperGradients?
 
### Built-in SOTA Models

Easily load and fine-tune production-ready, [pre-trained SOTA models](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients#pretrained-classification-pytorch-checkpoints) that incorporate best practices and validated hyper-parameters for achieving best-in-class accuracy.
    
### Easily Reproduce our Results
       
Why do all the grind work, if we already did it for you? leverage tested and proven [recipes](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/tree/master/src/super_gradients/recipes) & [code examples](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/tree/master/src/super_gradients/examples) for a wide range of computer vision models generated by our team of deep learning experts. Easily configure your own or use plug & play hyperparameters for training, dataset, and architecture.
    
### Production Readiness and Ease of Integration
    
All SuperGradients models‚Äô are production ready in the sense that they are compatible with deployment tools such as TensorRT (Nvidia) and OpenVINO (Intel) and can be easily taken into production. With a few lines of code you can easily integrate the models into your codebase.

# Model Checkpoints

The first question that arises is: what is a checkpoint?

From the [Pytorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) documentation:


    When a model is training, the performance changes as it sees more data. It is a best practice to save the state of a model throughout the training process. This gives you a version of the model, a checkpoint, at each key point during the development of the model. Once training has been completed, use the checkpoint corresponding to the best performance you found during the training process.
    
    Checkpoints also enable your training to resume where it was in case the training process is interrupted.

## Checkpoints Saving: Which, When, and Where?

From the previous subsection, we understand that checkpoints saved at different times during training have different purposes.
That's why in SG, multiple checkpoints are saved throughout training:

| Checkpoint Filename | When is it saved?|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `ckpt_best.pth` | Each time we reach a new best [metric_to_watch](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/69d8d19813964022af192a34b6e7853edac34a75/src/super_gradients/recipes/training_hyperparams/default_train_params.yaml#L39) when performing validation. |
| `ckpt_latest.pth` | At the end of every epoch, constantly overriding. |
| `average_model.pth` | At the end of training - composed of 10 best models according to  [metric_to_watch](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/69d8d19813964022af192a34b6e7853edac34a75/src/super_gradients/recipes/training_hyperparams/default_train_params.yaml#L39) and will only be save when the training_param `average_best_models`=True. |
| `ckpt_epoch_{EPOCH_INDEX}.pth` | At the end of a fixed epoch number `EPOCH_INDEX` if it is specified through `save_ckpt_epoch_list` training_param |

#### Where are the checkpoint files saved?

The checkpoint files will be saved at <PATH_TO_CKPT_ROOT_DIR>/experiment_name/.

The user controls the checkpoint root directory, which can be passed to the `Trainer` constructor through the `ckpt_root_dir` argument.

When working with a cloned version of SG, one can leave out the `ckpt_root_dir` arg, and checkpoints will be saved under the `super_gradients/checkpoints` directory.

## Checkpoint Structure

Checkpoints in SG are instances of [state_dict](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#what-is-a-state-dict).
They hold additional information about the model's training besides the model weights.

The checkpoint keys:

- `net`: The network's state_dict (state_dict).
- `acc`: The network's achieved metric value on the validation set ([metric_to_watch in training_params](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/69d8d19813964022af192a34b6e7853edac34a75/src/super_gradients/recipes/training_hyperparams/default_train_params.yaml#L39) (float).
- `epoch`: The last epoch performed.
- `optimizer_state_dict`: The state_dict of the optimizer (state_dict).
- `scaler_state_dict`: Optional - only present when training with [mixed_precision=True](average_mixed_precision.md). The state_dict of Trainer.scaler.
- `ema_net`: Optional - only present when training with [ema=True](EMA.md). The EMA model's state_dict. Note that `average_model.pth` lacks this entry even if ema=True since the average model's snapshots are of the EMA network already (i.e., the "net" entry is already an average of the EMA snapshots).
- `torch_scheduler_state_dict`: Optional, will only be present when using a torch native lr scheduler (see [LRScheduling](LRScheduling.md))
## Remote Checkpoint Saving with SG Loggers

SG supports remote checkpoint saving using 3rd party tools (for example, [Weights & Biases](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwi1iaLxhYj9AhXejWgJHZYqCGIYABAAGgJ3Zg&sig=AOD64_30zInAUka20YKKdULr8PHnLnLWgg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiKxZvxhYj9AhUzTKQEHSJwCkcQ0Qx6BAgGEAE)).
To do so, specify `save_checkpoints_remote=True` inside `sg_logger_params` training_param.
See our documentation on [Third-party experiment monitoring](experiment_monitoring.md).


## Loading Checkpoints

When discussing checkpoint loading in SG, we must separate it into two use cases: loading weights and resuming training.
While the former requires the model's state_dict alone, SG checkpoint loading methods introduce more functionality than PyTorch's vanilla `load_state_dict()`, especially for SG-trained checkpoints.

### Loading Model Weights from a Checkpoint

Loading model weights can be done right after model initialization, using `models.get(...)`, or by explicitly calling `load_checkpoint_to_model` on the `torch.nn.Module` instance.

Suppose we have launched a training experiment with a similar structure to the one below:

```python
from super_gradients.training import Trainer
...
...
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models

trainer = Trainer("my_resnet18_training_experiment", ckpt_root_dir="/path/to/my_checkpoints_folder")
train_dataloader = ...
valid_dataloader = ...
model = models.get(model_name=Models.RESNET18, num_classes=10)

train_params = {
    ...
    "loss": "cross_entropy",
    "criterion_params": {},
    "save_ckpt_epoch_list": [10,15]
    ...
}
trainer.train(model=model, training_params=train_params, train_loader=train_dataloader, valid_loader=valid_dataloader)
```

Then at the end of the training, our `ckpt_root_dir` contents will look similar to the following:

```
my_checkpoints_folder
|─── my_resnet18_training_experiment
│       ckpt_best.pth                     # Model checkpoint on best epoch
│       ckpt_latest.pth                   # Model checkpoint on last epoch
│       average_model.pth                 # Model checkpoint averaged over epochs
|       ckpt_epoch_10.pth                 # Model checkpoint of epoch 10
|       ckpt_epoch_15.pth                 # Model checkpoint of epoch 15
│       events.out.tfevents.1659878383... # Tensorflow artifacts of a specific run
│       log_Aug07_11_52_48.txt            # Trainer logs of a specific run
└─── some_other_training_experiment_name
        ...
```

Suppose we wish to load the weights from `ckpt_best.pth`. We can simply pass its path to the `checkpoint_path` argument in `models.get(...)`:

```python
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models

model = models.get(model_name=Models.RESNET18, num_classes=10, checkpoint_path="/path/to/my_checkpoints_folder/my_resnet18_training_experiment/ckpt_best.pth")
```

> Important: when loading SG-trained checkpoints using models.get(...), if the network was trained with EMA, the EMA weights will be the ones loaded. 

If we already possess an instance of our model, we can also directly use `load_checkpoint_to_model`:

```python
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models
from super_gradients.training.utils.checkpoint_utils import load_checkpoint_to_model

model = models.get(model_name=Models.RESNET18, num_classes=10)
load_checkpoint_to_model(net=model, ckpt_local_path="/path/to/my_checkpoints_folder/my_resnet18_training_experiment/ckpt_best.pth")
```
### Extending the Functionality of PyTorch's `strict` Parameter in `load_state_dict()`

When not familiar with PyTorch's `strict` parameter in `load_state_dict()`, please see [PyTorch's docs on this matter](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#id4) first.

The equivalent arguments for PyTorch's `strict` parameter in `load_state_dict()` in `models.get()` and `load_checkpoint_to_model` are `strict` and `strict_load` respectively, and expect SG's `StrictLoad` enum type.

Let's have a look at its possible values:

```python

class StrictLoad(Enum):
    """
    Wrapper for adding more functionality to torch's strict_load parameter in load_state_dict().
    Attributes:
        OFF              - Native torch "strict_load = off" behavior. See nn.Module.load_state_dict() documentation for more details.
        ON               - Native torch "strict_load = on" behavior. See nn.Module.load_state_dict() documentation for more details.
        NO_KEY_MATCHING  - Allows the usage of SuperGradient's adapt_checkpoint function, which loads a checkpoint by matching each
                           layer's shapes (and bypasses the strict matching of the names of each layer (i.e., disregards the state_dict key matching)).
    """

    OFF = False
    ON = True
    NO_KEY_MATCHING = "no_key_matching"

```

In other words, we added another loading mode option- `no_key_matching`. This option exploits the fact that the `state_dicts` are `OrderedDict`s, and comes in handy when the underlying network's structure remains the same, but the `state_dict`s keys do not match the ones inside the models `state_dict`.
Let's demonstrate the different strict modes with a simple example:

```python
import torch

class ModelA(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelA, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)

class ModelB(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelB, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.CONV2 = torch.nn.Sequential([torch.nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)])
        
```

Notice the above networks have identical weight structures but will have different keys in their `state_dict`s.
This is why loading a checkpoint from either one to the other, using `strict=True`, will fail and crash. Using `strict=False` will not crash and successfully load the first layer's weights only.
Using SG's `no_key_matching` will successfully load a checkpoint from either one to the other.

### Loading Pretrained Weights from the Model Zoo

Using `models.get(...)`, you can load any of our pre-trained models in 3 lines of code:
```python
from super_gradients.training import models
from super_gradients.common.object_names import Models

model = models.get(Models.YOLOX_S, pretrained_weights="coco")
```

The `pretrained_weights` argument specifies the dataset on which the pre-trained weights were trained. [Here is the complete list of pre-trained weights](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/src/super_gradients/training/Computer_Vision_Models_Pretrained_Checkpoints.md).


### Loading Checkpoints: Training with Configuration Files

Prerequisites: [Training with Configuration Files](configuration_files.md)

Recall the SGs recipes library structure:


The `super_gradients/recipes` include the following subdirectories

- arch_params - containing configuration files for instantiating different models
- checkpoint_params - containing configuration files that define the loaded and saved checkpoints parameters for the training
- conversion_params - containing configuration files for the model conversion scripts (for deployment)
- dataset_params - containing configuration files for instantiating different datasets and dataloaders
- training_hyperparams - containing configuration files holding hyper-parameters for specific recipes

And now, let's take a look at the default parameters in `checkpoint_params`:

```yaml
load_backbone: False # whether to load only the backbone part of the checkpoint
checkpoint_path: # checkpoint path that is located in super_gradients/checkpoints
strict_load: True # key matching strictness for loading checkpoint's weights
pretrained_weights: # a string describing the dataset of the pre-trained weights (for example, "imagenent").
```

And note the above parameters are used to start the training with different weights (fine-tuning etc.) - they are passed to model.get() in the underlying flow of `Trainer.train_from_config(...)`:
```python

@classmethod
def train_from_config(cls, cfg: Union[DictConfig, dict]) -> Tuple[nn.Module, Tuple]:
    ...

    # BUILD NETWORK
    model = models.get(
        ...
        strict_load=cfg.checkpoint_params.strict_load,
        pretrained_weights=cfg.checkpoint_params.pretrained_weights,
        checkpoint_path=cfg.checkpoint_params.checkpoint_path,
        load_backbone=cfg.checkpoint_params.load_backbone,
    )

    # INSTANTIATE DATA LOADERS

    train_dataloader = ...
    val_dataloader = ...
    
    ...

    # TRAIN
    res = trainer.train(...)
... 
```

## Resuming Training

In SG, we separate the logic of resuming training from loading model weights. Therefore, continuing training is controlled by two arguments, passed through `training_params`: `resume` and `resume_path`:
```yaml
...
resume: False # whether to continue training from ckpt with the same experiment name.
resume_path: # Explicit checkpoint path (.pth file) to resume training.
...
```

Setting `resume=True` will take the training related state_dicts from `/PATH/TO/MY_CKPT_ROOT_DIR/MY_EXPERIMENT_NAME/ckpt_latest.pth`.
Stating explicitly a `resume_path` will continue training from an explicit checkpoint.

In both cases, SG allows flexibility of the other training-related parameters. For example, we can resume a training experiment and run it for more epochs:


```shell
python -m super_gradients.train_from_recipe --config-name=cifar10_resnet experiment_name=cifar_experiment training_hyperparams.resume=True training_hyperparams.max_epochs=300
```

```shell
python -m super_gradients.train_from_recipe --config-name=cifar10_resnet experiment_name=cifar_experiment training_hyperparams.resume=True training_hyperparams.max_epochs=400
```

However, this flexibility comes with a price: we must be aware of any change in parameters (by command line overrides or hard-coded changes inside the yaml file configurations) if we wish to resume training.

For this reason, SG also offers a safer option for resuming interrupted training - the `Trainer.resume_experiment(...)` method. It takes two arguments: `experiment_name` - the experiment's name to continue, and `ckpt_root_dir` - the directory including the checkpoints. It will resume training with the same settings the training was launched with.
Note that resuming training this way requires the interrupted training to be launched with configuration files (i.e., `Trainer.train_from_config`), which outputs the Hydra final config to the `.hydra` directory inside the checkpoints directory.
See usage in our [resume_experiment_example](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/src/super_gradients/examples/resume_experiment_example/resume_experiment.py).

## Resuming Training from SG Logger's Remote Storage (WandB only)

SG supports saving checkpoints throughout the training process in the remote storage defined by `SG Logger` (more info about this object and it's role during training in SG at [Third-party experiment monitoring](experiment_monitoring.md).)
Suppose we run an experiment with a `WandB` SG logger, then our `training_hyperparams` should hold:
```yaml
sg_logger: wandb_sg_logger, # Weights&Biases Logger, see class super_gradients.common.sg_loggers.wandb_sg_logger.WandBSGLogger for details
sg_logger_params:             # Params that will be passes to __init__ of the logger super_gradients.common.sg_loggers.wandb_sg_logger.WandBSGLogger
  project_name: project_name, # W&B project name
  save_checkpoints_remote: True,
  save_tensorboard_remote: True,
  save_logs_remote: True,
  entity: <YOUR-ENTITY-NAME>,         # username or team name where you're sending runs
  api_server: <OPTIONAL-WANDB-URL>    # Optional: In case your experiment tracking is not hosted at wandb servers
```

The `save_checkpoints_remote` flag is set which will result in saving checkpoints in WandB throughout training.
Now, in case the training was interrupted, we can resume it from the checkpoint located in the WandB run storage by setting 2 training hyperparameters:
1. Set `resume_from_remote_sg_logger`:
```yaml
resume_from_remote_sg_logger: True
```
2. Pass `run_id` through  `wandb_id` to `sg_logger_params`:
```yaml
sg_logger: wandb_sg_logger, # Weights&Biases Logger, see class super_gradients.common.sg_loggers.wandb_sg_logger.WandBSGLogger for details
sg_logger_params:             # Params that will be passes to __init__ of the logger super_gradients.common.sg_loggers.wandb_sg_logger.WandBSGLogger
  wandb_id: <YOUR_RUN_ID>
  project_name: project_name, # W&B project name
  save_checkpoints_remote: True,
  save_tensorboard_remote: True,
  save_logs_remote: True,
  entity: <YOUR-ENTITY-NAME>,         # username or team name where you're sending runs
  api_server: <OPTIONAL-WANDB-URL>    # Optional: In case your experiment tracking is not hosted at wandb servers
```

And that's it! Once you re-launch your training, `ckpt_latest.pth` (by default) will be downloaded to the checkpoints directory, and the training will resume from it just as if it was locally stored.

## Evaluating Checkpoints

Analogically to the previous section, we often want to evaluate a checkpoint seamlessly without being familiar with the training configuration.
For this reason, SG introduces two methods: `Trainer.evaluate_checkpoint(...)` and `Trainer.evaluate_recipe(...)` and play similar roles to the two previous ways of resuming experiments suggested in the last section:

`Trainer.evaluate_checkpoint` is used to evaluate a checkpoint resulting from one of your previous experiments, using the same parameters (dataset, valid_metrics,...) as used during the training of the experiment.
`Trainer.evaluate_recipe`  is used to evaluate a checkpoint from SGs pre-trained model zoo or to evaluate a checkpoint with different parameters.
See both usages and documentation in the corresponding scripts [evaluate_checkpoint](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/src/super_gradients/examples/evaluate_checkpoint_example/evaluate_checkpoint.py) and [evaluate_recipe](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients/blob/master/src/super_gradients/examples/evaluate_checkpoint_example/evaluate_checkpoint.py).

#  DEKR training example with COCO dataset.
#  Reproduction and refinement of paper: Bottom-Up Human Pose Estimation Via Disentangled Keypoint Regression.
#
#  Recipe runs with batch size = 8 X 8 gpus = 64.
#
#  Instructions:
#   0. Make sure that the data is stored in dataset_params.dataset_dir or add "dataset_params.data_dir=<PATH-TO-DATASET>" at the end of the command below (feel free to check ReadMe)
#   1. Move to the project root (where you will find the ReadMe and src folder)
#   2. Run the command:
#       DEKR-W32: python -m super_gradients.train_from_recipe --config-name=coco2017_pose_dekr_w32_no_dc
#  NOTE: Add "checkpoint_params.checkpoint_path=<hrnet-pretrained-path>" to use pretrained backbone (See line 55).
#
#
#  Validation AP (Without multiscale & flip augmentation) - COCO, training time:
#      DEKR-W32:    input-size: [640, 640]     AP: TBD    8 X RTX A5000

#
#
#  Comments:
#      * Pretrained backbones were used.
#      * Results with Deci code are higher than original implementation, mostly thanks to changes in Detail loss and
#          module, different auxiliary feature maps and different loss weights.

#   Note: You can uncomment following block to enable visualization of intermediate results during training.
#   When enabled, these callbacks will save first batch from training & validation to Tensorboard.
#   This is helpful for debugging and doing visual checks whether predictions are reasonable and transforms are
#   working as expected.
#   The only downside is that it tend to bloat Tensorboard logs (Up to ten Gigs for long training regimes).

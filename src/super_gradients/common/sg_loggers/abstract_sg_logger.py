    A SGLogger handles all outputs of the training process.
    Every generated file, log, metrics value, image or other artifacts produced by the trainer will be processed and saved.

    Inheriting SGLogger can be used in order to integrate experiment management framework, special storage setting, a specific logging library etc.

    Important: The BaseSGLogger class (inheriting from SGLogger) is used by the trainer by default. When defining your own SGLogger you will
    override all default output functionality. No files will saved to disk and no data will be collected.
    Make sure you either implement this functionality or use SGLoggers.Compose([BaseSGLogger(...), YourSGLogger(...)]) to build on top of it.
